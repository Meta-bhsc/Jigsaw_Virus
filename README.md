!!!!! Do Not Run This Program Unless On Virtual Machine !!!!!

This program does delete files.
I do suggest that this program is ran on a virtual machine.
I take no responsibilty for anything happening to you or someone elses computer for your actions.

What this program does is, it starts a timer, tells you what you have to do, puts a random generated code in a random folder in your computer, you then have to find the file and put that code in to close it and remove the virus from your computer.

I do not suggest that you close it with task manager or restart your computer, because it will delete files if you do. So also dont start it on accident. 

The StartupFolder.zip contains the files that is placed in your startup folder such as the delete file.

To run the file you can run USB Driver Updte.bat OR you can run Jigsaw_Virus.exe.

All files are needed in the same directory to work. This is the older version and I dont intend on updating it to have it all compressed in one exe file.
